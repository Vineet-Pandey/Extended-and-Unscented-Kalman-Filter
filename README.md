# Extended-and-Unscented-Kalman-Filter
EKF and UKF models used for State Estimation of a Magnetic Needle

This project presents an overview of development in
the field of Observers and Estimators for Linear and Non-linear
systems. Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and Unscented Kalman
Filter (UKF) are found to be suitable for the magnetic needle
.Both the filters are implemented and their performances
are compared. It is found that UKF outperforms EKF. Detailed
implementation and performance have been described in the
implementation section.

Software Package: MATLAB 2017a or higher
